Experiments with NLTK and python.

## Setup

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Either follow the instructions on the NLTK website or download the Latest Pythong 3 installer.

I created a requirements.txt file to manage the list of packages needed.


To setup you run.

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you want to run the download script like this.

```cmd
python download.py
```

it will show a dialog like this.

I just downloaded the popular dataset.
